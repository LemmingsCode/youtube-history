# youtube-history
My Youtube Data for my coding journey since May 2021. Updated on a regular basis.

I started with Python, explored Solidity, and now I'm on Javascript and looking to commit to Javascript to land a web dev job. Looking to revisit Solidity once I have a better grasp on JS, React, and NodeJS.

The purpose of this repository is to track my Youtube history for everything coding related. I created a separate Google account just for coding to log my history and help the Youtube algorithm adjust my feed to show me videos that will help me further on my coding journey. 

Feel free to subscribe to any of the channels that I am subscribed to, they have all helped me immensely. I was only expecting to find tutorial videos on Youtube, but I am very fortunate that almost every developer talks about their career path and challenges along the way as well. This information has been invaluable in guiding me to think about my career path much more clearly than I would have been otherwise.
